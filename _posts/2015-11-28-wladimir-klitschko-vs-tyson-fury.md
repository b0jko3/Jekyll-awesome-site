Wladimir Klitschko vs. Tyson Fury, billed as Kollisionskurs (German for "Collision Course"), was a professional boxing match contested for the WBA (Super), WBO, IBF, IBO, The Ring magazine, and lineal heavyweight titles. The fight took place on November 28, 2015 at Esprit Arena, DÃ¼sseldorf, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany. Fury was declared the winner by unanimous decision. This ended Klitschko's reign of nearly 10 years, the second longest in heavyweight history. Klitschko was entitled to a rematch per the fight contract. Despite this, Fury was stripped of the IBF heavyweight title for agreeing to the rematch instead of facing the IBF mandatory challenger, Vyacheslav Glazkov.
